			<h3>From Eau Claire to Madison</h3>
			<p>I am here today by the grace and generosity of friends, family and community that helped me grow into the man I am today. These experiences instilled in me values such as integrity and responsibility. I will uphold those values in the office of Lieutenant Governor for the State of Wisconsin.</p>
			<p>My story is one not likely to be unfamiliar to many across our great state. My parents, who have been together for more than 45 years, were the owners of a small tire shop and worked tirelessly to provide for their six children. However, at the age of six, my family’s world changed when my father suffered a brain injury due to an accident in the shop. Undeterred, my father fought to provide for my mother, brothers, and sisters, including my sister with Down Syndrome, in any way that he could. Due to his limitations and disabilities we relied on Social Security Disability payments, and public housing, and at times putting meals on the table using the foodshare program. My father did what he could to manage for his family within his limitations. Moreover, this meant that we relied on our friends, family, and community for support. </p>
			<p>I know what it is like to live and work through adversity, and I also realize how important support and being given dignity is to success. I also know what it is like trying to make ends meet while supporting myself by holding two, sometimes three jobs. At 17 years old I was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, and I fought my way through life’s struggles, attempting to improve and better myself with an education, and all the while being concerned how am I going to manage if I get really sick since I wasn’t able to pay for health insurance. Most services are cut off after you earn a certain amount. As it is true for me and my family, these are challenges many Wisconsinites and their families face. Health care costs should not be in competition with the grocery bill. This is not just about being able to survive; it is about having an opportunity to thrive.</p>
			<p><strong>That’s why it matters I am the next Lt. Governor! I am committed to ensuring that individuals, families, small businesses and communities in this state thrive!</strong> I will take my rural and small town values I learned growing up in Eau Claire to Madison. My vision for Wisconsin takes us to the next level and includes leadership that is guided by the values of <strong>Integrity, Responsibility</strong>, and <strong>Generosity</strong>. These values generate equity, and there is great economic opportunity created by equity and equality. I am committed to include all voices at the table.</p>

			<h3>What will take us to the next level?</h3>
			<h4 class="center">Equity In Education</h4>
			<p class="center italic">How would equity in education benefit you? Your kids?</p>
			<p><strong>Education</strong> from kindergarten to apprenticeships to the university and technical school <strong>is a priority</strong>. All of us benefit from education. We must therefore  guarantee that schools, the teachers, and communities receive the necessary funding, and ensure that our students are safe. We must also think about creative approaches to education, ensure that students have increased options to complement their own strengths thereby strengthening our economy. Moreover, education must be accessible and affordable; much of our workforce is saddled with crushing student loan debt to the tune of $24 billion or approximately $30,000 per college student in Wisconsin, further diminishing their buying power and negatively affecting our economy. We can do something and we will!</p>

			<h4 class="center">Equity in Health Care</h4>
			<p class="center italic">What could be possible?</p>
			<p>Far too often, Wisconsin citizens forgo necessary medicines and preventative healthcare services due to the burdensome costs associated with these services. When people forgo these services, there is a ripple effect across the community. A working mother who can’t afford regular mammograms doesn’t catch her breast cancer at a treatable stage. A young adult can’t afford behavioral healthcare and his depression goes left untreated, causing him to quit his job. These examples are infinite. If you don’t have your health, you cannot participate fully in your job, be there for your family, or grow your business. This has become a barrier to progress in our state and to businesses. <strong>What is possible is that is Wisconsin is at the forefront of creating public health access and affordable care.</strong> Life is an inalienable right, and one cannot exercise that right without access to healthcare. Healthy individuals make for a healthy family, community, and economy!</p>

			<h4 class="center">Equity in Modern Infrastructure and Small Business Development</h4>
			<p class="center italic">Why does this matter?</p>
			<p>We must support small business creation and innovation right here in this state, creating opportunity for all individuals and businesses. Without modern infrastructure, such as efficient and safe roads, mass transit, and high-speed internet access throughout the state, we limit the opportunities small companies have to innovate and expand. Making this a priority allows us to attract companies to Wisconsin without having to give away the farm to get them here.</p>

			<h4 class="center">Equity in the Environment</h4>
			<p class="center italic">How is it possible?</p>
			<p>Wisconsin is known for its beauty and its natural resources, so much so that tourism is a $20 billion dollar industry in Wisconsin. As a state, we need to prioritize the heritage of our natural resources for future generations. How this is accomplished is by investing in renewable resources, protecting our public treasures, land, water, and air from contamination. Short term gains from industry and corporations should not be prioritized over the safety of the environment and public health.</p>

			<h4 class="center">Criminal Justice Reform</h4>
			<p class="center italic">Where do we begin?</p>
			<p>We can begin by addressing issues such as over incarceration, racial and ethnic disparities, supporting community policing efforts, and.decriminalizing cannabis. <strong>More of our tax dollars go into our correctional system and keeping people incarcerated than we spend on all of the University of Wisconsin System.</strong> We need to invest in Wisconsin communities and invest prevention. We have long used drug policies that are costly and ineffective to keep communities safe and fight crime. We need to view addiction as a health and a community issue and not as criminal justice issue. By making criminal justice reform a priority we’ll avoid paying for unnecessary incarcerations and burdening the court systems. The savings obtained can be used to help pay for programs that help communities pay for needed mental health care and educational programs that keep our communities safe.</p>

			<h3>Will you join us?</h3>
			<p>To produce results for the benefit of all Wisconsinites, we must work together.  My experience working in the private sector, living and working abroad in Mexico, our state’s third largest trading partner, and working nine years with four different state agencies and departments has prepared me to work with all types of people to meet our state’s needs, ensure you are heard, and build our future. I’ve seen through my experience as a public servant how our current governor and lieutenant governor’s failure to listen to the very ones that have knowledge of the issues has impacted my friends, family and neighbors. I’ve seen how the current policies have impacted how local governments struggle to provide services and infringe on local control, and on individual rights.</p>
			<p>These policies, and not being willing to work across the isle, has caused individuals to leave Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a state that has more people leaving than there are coming in. For example, while there are jobs to be had in this state, many are not paying a livable wage. Many people must still hold two or three jobs to provide for their families. We need to invest in the future of our young adults and families. Over 2 billion dollars was removed from the education system impacting communities, teachers and most importantly students! Education is a priority and we’ll make it a priority.</p>
			<p>How have your friends and neighbors been impacted? What about you, have you been impacted? Does government work for you? We want to know! <strong>As your next Lt. Governor I want you to know, you will be and are heard!</strong> We have an amazing opportunity to not only have conversations over the coming months until I am elected on November 6, 2018, but to also have the conversations that create meaningful action that builds our future!</p>
			<p>I invite to you join our team <strong>#teamwisconsin #teamcorban</strong> and let your voice <strong>#beheard.</strong></p>
